* Before running any of our code make sure that none of your instances are running. You should terminate all your running instances.

Prerequisites to run on EC2:

1. Your credential file to be at this location "~/.aws/credentials"
     Your credential file should have the format:
     - access key ID
     - Secret access key
     - region = us-west-2
     - output format = json

2. Generate key pair with the name "ec2-key.pem" and save it in your current directory from where you will run the code.

3. You have to create a security group on ec2 instances with the name "ec2-sec-key"

4. Add rule "Allow all traffic" in your security group for inbound and outbound traffic.

5. chmod 400 ec2-key.pem

6. Set the permissions of credential file to CHMOD 400

7. chmod +x start-cluster.sh stop-cluster.sh

=================================== Run ======================================

$ make compile
$ ./start-cluster 8
$ ./my-mapreduce WordCount.jar s3://foo/bar/input.txt s3://foo/bar/output
$ ./stop-cluster

Final output will be placed at the location specified by the client.
NOTE: Jar name must be same as the Main Class name for the Job
NOTE: Start Cluster script terminates when Stop cluster is called, since it is used for tracking the Job Status
